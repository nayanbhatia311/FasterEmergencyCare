# FasterEmergencyCare
The proposed system is demonstrated with the help of CARLA Simulation.  An accident will trigger our system to execute the sequence of actions such as calling emergency services, relatives and sharing accident details like accident type, location, severity, etc. via call, SMS and a webpage.  
Refer this link: https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.5. 
Place the current file inside CARLA_0.9.5/PythonAPI/examples/* to run the simulations.
